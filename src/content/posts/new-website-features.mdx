import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge";
import VideoSortButtonsSuspense from "~/components/VideoSortButtons";

Just some website changes and updates that have been planned or are currently in production!

## New Website Features

### Currently in production

A lot of cool stuff has been made in the last few days, here is a list of some of them:

#### Video List

This page has been in production for a hot minute. It allows you to see all of my videos (updated ever night at midnight UTC) allowing you to see stats like likes, viewsm abd publish date.

#### Video Sorting

A new feature pushed to production today in the abbility to sort videos in the video list.

<div>
  <Badge>Interactive</Badge> The sorting looks like this:
</div>
<br />
<VideoSortButtonsSuspense client:only="react" />
<br />

#### New color scheme

The color scheme has been updated, just look around the site, you'll see it.

### In the works

#### Soundboard

I'm working on a soundboard for my streams to replace the Blerp soundboard. This feature is in early development but should be up soon.

### Planned

#### Now Streaming Badge

I'm planning on adding a now streaming badge (like the interactive badge above) to the site's navbar.

Have a good day/night! \

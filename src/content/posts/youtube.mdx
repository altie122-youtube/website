Due to quite a few issues with how youtube it's self works, I no longer plan to post on youtube...

## Wait WHAT?!?

I'm not going away, only leaving youtube. as of now, I have no plans to return to youtube, but I will be focusing on my twitch channel and tiktok account. any videos on my youtube channel will continue to be avaiable.

Now with that out of the way;

## Why?

TLDR: YouTube is completely for large "Corporatetized" creators.

Simple. Its too hard for small content creators to grow a community on youtube, and with my stream vods taking upwards of 14 hours to upload, then proceeding to get 10-30 views is not worth the time nor effort...

Over the last few months YouTube has been getting way harder to grow on, unless you have a large budget and team, its hard if not impossible to get a channel to grow.

If you look at any channel with a lot of views and subscribers, you'll see that they have teams and hundreds of thousands of dollars to pour into videos. I'm not even talking Mr. Beast scale, but any youtube channel with a few hundred thousand views and a couple hundred thousand subscribers almost certainly has a team behind it. there are some that dont, but its rare to see.

## Whats next?

As stated before, I will focus on my twitch channel and tiktok account, I will try to start uploading and streaming more regularly now that I dont have to worry about recording, nor uploading VOD's. I will be posting my last youtube video on April 11th 2025. I will also try to post a video or two leading up to that video, and I may post short conent on there still, I'm not sure yet, and likely wont be sure until later.

I plan to take most of december off before I start streaming a lot again.

I don't mean for this post to discourage you from starting your own channel, I just want to make it clear that I dont plan to continue posting. Please chase your dreams and hell, if you start a channel, tell me! I'm always looking for new content to watch since you can only watch the same ten "TheRussianBadger" videos so many times.

Sorry for the less professional post, I'm trying to get this out as fast as possible, so there are likely spelling and grammar errors, though I'm sure my main mod will point them out to me...

Thank you for reading,\

Have a good day/night!\

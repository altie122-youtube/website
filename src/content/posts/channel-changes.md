First blog post! But I'm not here to celebrate that, I have, and plan on making a ton of changes to the channel this year! I would also like to talk about what was up with last year.
## The channel's identity crises
Last year was a mess for the channel. I started 2023 off with 3 channels under the names: "Altie's Gaming", "Altie's Gaming Infinite" and "Altie's Gaming Live". I had also gotten the domain name "altiesgamingstudios.com" the month before, I thought that that was the path the channels were going to go on. Then I renamed the channels to: "AltiesGaming", "AltiesGamingInfinite" and "AltiesGamingLive" I did this as YouTube was rolling out handles. Then just a few weeks later, I got rid of "AltiesGamingInfinite" and "AltiesGamingLive" so I only had "AltiesGaming". After a few months, I rebranded to "DragonForgeNEXUS", and the channel got rebranded to "DragonForgeGaming". Just a week later I split my channel from "DragonForgeNEXUS" and renamed it "Altie122". Last year was a mess for my channel, and I don't plan on doing that again, Altie122 is here to stay.
## My plans
This year I plan to make fewer videos (even from last year's handful) but there will be more uploads of unedited VODs from my Twitch, this is to go without saying, I will be posting videos still, in fact, the first one is planned to be this week!
My main content has and will be changing a lot. First, the super family-friendly content is going, this doesn't mean that I'm going to stop making family-friendly content altogether, it's just going to be few and far between, mostly when I play games oriented towards kids like Minecraft or Roblox. I plan to stop watching my language as much and play more M-rated games like Call Of Duty and The Elder Scrolls more than Minecraft and Roblox. Next and on the topic of Minecraft, it's going away almost completely, especially with how the MCYT community has been I want to separate from it, nevermind me not being as into Minecraft as I was even just a few months ago, BlossomCraft will be staying though :D. I will also be streaming way more than recording videos. Finally, I plan on making more content than just gaming, the video I have planned for this week is going to be a programming video!\
\
That is largely it for today, I do plan to get more update posts out in the next week, but for what I wanted to talk about today, that's it!
Thank you for reading,\
Have a good day/night!\
Altie\

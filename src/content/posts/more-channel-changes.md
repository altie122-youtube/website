I hope to make this the last Channel Change Blog post for a while.

## What is changing?

For now, its mostly content that will be changing. 



I plan and have switched to only streaming, with YouTube uploads of the VODs from the streams. I do not plan to make many long form prerecorded videos this year. I do want to make shorts from the VODs and upload them semi-regularly. 



For content it's self I will be working to stream 3 times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. These streams will be Planned out on my Schedule (link @ the end of the post) I may also do more streams during the week, but there will at least be 3 streams a week.



I am working to get caught up on vod uploads, they should be done by this Wednesday. and vod uploads will start happening on the day after the stream. \
\
I'm also working on a few simple little coding tutorials that will be prerecorded content. They will ***not*** be recorded live. \
\
I'm also working to get my stream soundboard (Blerp) replaced with my own. this will get it's own blog post a bit later though.\
\
Have a good day/night!\
Altie

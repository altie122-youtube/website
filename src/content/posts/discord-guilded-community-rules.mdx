## Main rules

### NSFW content

All NSFW content is prohibited **_EXCEPT_**:

- Light to medium gore (please add the image into a spoiler if possible)
- Major gore (large open wounds, lots of blood, inner body parts, bloody battles etc) MUST be put under a spoiler with a CLEAR warning.
- If the content is questionable, please ask if it's allowed in a ticket

### Be respectful

No hate or drama is tolerated in this server, regardless of your opinion on them. This means absolutely no racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia etc. Treat others with the respect you would like to be treated with.

### No Spamming

Spamming is prohibited (anywhere but in #the-endless-pit) and if you are caught spamming, whether that be through text, images, links, text images, etc. you will face disciplinary action.

### Server Raiding/Trolling

Mentions of raiding this or any other server will result in disciplinary action. Trolling in this server will result in disciplinary action.

### No Religious/Political Talk

This server is not a political or religious debating server. Keep all discussions based on these two topics and relating topics out of this server.

### Language

This is an English only server!

### Slurs & Swearing

This Server disallows any slur that can be found offensive to a race/group/religion. Regardless of intent in posting it, whether it is "reclaimed" or not, etc, they are banned from use. This includes media with slurs as well, joke or not. Swearing definitely is allowed however, just be respectful of other folks.

### Alt Accounts

You are allowed to have one alt account in the server. Alt accounts MUST be disclosed to a moderator at the time of joining, and the bio of the account must include the name of the owner/main account (i.e. This account belongs to user @MainAccount). Any alt account that does not meet both of these requirements will be banned, and the owner will face disciplinary action.

### Follow the Discord/Guilded Community Guidelines and TOS

- https://discord.com/terms

#### Guilded

- https://support.guilded.gg/hc/en-us/articles/360039728313-Terms-of-Use

### **_NOTICE_**

Rules function AS INTENDED. Just because you bend the wording of a rule into a pretzel and don't break the specific RAW (Rule As Written) does not mean you didn't break the RAI (Rule As Intended). Rules can be subject to interpretation and if the Admins and Mods believe you broke a rule as it is INTENDED to function, you can expect the same consequences. All rules can apply to profiles as well as communications.

These rules may change at any time, with or without warning. It is your job to keep up to date on the rules.

## Venting and Support

Everyone has tough times. Be it a bad day you wish to rant about, or an issue that has been with you for a while you wish to get support on, then there are many resources that can help.

I would like to state that while this server will allow light venting and ranting about light issues, no one here is a professional.

We cannot help you with major issues. We can offer support and a shoulder to lean on, but please realise we are just other people stuck behind a screen.

So, while this server offers community-support for those who have friends and such here and wish to rant with a shoulder to lean on and people to listen, please remember that, once again, no one here is a professional and that there are other resources available.

If you are having a hard time in life, be it traumatic, mental health related, etc, please try and seek professional help!

If you are having any thoughts of _suicide_ or _self-harm_, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL HOTLINE!

If you do not know your local hotline, [GOOGLE "_suicide hotline_" (or click here)](google.com/search?q=suicide+hotline) AND YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY TOLD.
